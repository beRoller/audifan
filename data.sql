A LOT of things, but here are the two biggest improvements:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. The new server will only host Audifan and its sister sites (other sites made by Mana Web Development).  Currently, Audifan is on a shared server, which is shared with about 20-30 other websites.  We''ve been very fortunate to have great server neighbors over the years and their sites haven''t caused any issues on Audifan.  However, this change ensures that the server will always prioritize Audifan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. HTTPS!  Our current hosting provider does not easily support HTTPS, but the new server provider does.  This means you will be able to use Audifan securely with an encrypted connection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we officially move to the new server, the site will be taken down for a few hours as the new server address gets updated throughout the Internet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of your account data will be moved over, so the switch should be relatively seamless.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current plan is to make the switch on April 22, most likely in the evening.  We''ll announce a time once the date gets closer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can try the new server right now at <a href="https://staging.audifan.net">https://staging.audifan.net</a>!

I decided to combine my love for Audition and coding to create Audifan, and it eventually grew into what it is today.  My goal from the start was never to make a profit off the site.  I just wanted to make a site that I thought was cool and useful for myself and other players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, fast forward eleven years to today, and I haven''t played the game in almost two years.  And, honestly, I can''t really be invested in maintaining a site for a game that I don''t play anymore.  Therefore, unfortunately, I feel it''s time for me to start winding-down the site.  As of today, I will be "freezing" Audifan.  Any existing content will remain as-is, but features that require an administrator (Quests and the VIP Drawing) have been discontinued.  Also, I will work on sending out the remaining VIP Drawing prizes that haven''t been sent out yet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAudifan will be taken offline this summer.  I''ll announce a specific date when the time gets nearer.  The code used on the site will be added to GitHub, if anyone would like to use any of it.  No account information will be included.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI want to thank every person who helped me along the way.  Everyone who gave suggestions.  Everyone who helped test new features.  Everyone who helped grade quest submissions.  Everyone who sent corrections.  Everyone who recorded song times.  Everyone who simply logged in and gave the site their attention for a few minutes each day.  I''ve had so much fun along the way, and you guys are awesome!  I may have built the site, but just as a house becomes a home, so does a website become a community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoodbye and good luck!', 1520054491),
